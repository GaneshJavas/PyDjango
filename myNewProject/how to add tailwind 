Install tailwind if you have created virtual environment using uv
    -- uv pip install django-tailwind
    ELSE
    -- python -m pip install django-tailwind

If you are facing issues during installation then:
    need to install pip inside virtual environment
    -- python -m ensurepip --upgrade
    -- python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Reload packages
    -- pip install 'django-tailwind[reload]'

Add 'tailwind' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
  # other Django apps
  'tailwind',
]

Create a Tailwind CSS compatible Django app, I like to call it theme:
    -- python manage.py tailwind init

Add your newly created 'theme' app to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
  # other Django apps
  'tailwind',
  'theme'
]

Adding the following line to settings.py file:
TAILWIND_APP_NAME = 'theme'
INTERNAL_IPS = [
    "127.0.0.1",
]

Install Tailwind CSS dependencies
    -- python manage.py tailwind install
